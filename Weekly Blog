#Week 1:
Zala Habib:
In Week 1 we came together as a group for the first time on Thursday, 
most of us meeting for the first time. We assigned ourselves general 
roles and figuring out what we would be doing for the coming weeks. 
Tim and Cam started on some basic code, getting the gate control and
straight line movement code done but not tested. Ian got most of the
chassis done while Jimmy and I set up contacts, meetings and our AVC
plan, including our goals for the coming weeks.
