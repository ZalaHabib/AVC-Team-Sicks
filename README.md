# AVC-Teem-Sicks
Progress upates and goals for AVC

#Week 7
- [ ] Tim and Cam: Finish quadrant 3 & quadrant 4 if possible
- [ ] Ian: Maintenance, wire organization
- [ ] Zala: Run final tests, document results, finish sketches
- [ ] James: Clean up wires and design, attempt quadrant 4 code
Progress:
* 

#Week 6
- [ x] Tim and Cam: ~~Quadrant 3 code~~, get PID fully functional, ~~Quadrant 4 code~~
- [x] Ian: Print off designs and apply
- [x] Zala: ~~Finish design sketches~~, photograph components
- [x] James: Get 3D printed designs finished, research components
Progress:
* Fixed Quadrant 2 code
* PID started working
* Fixed opposite turning wheels
* Got robot to successfully navigate quadrant 1 and 2 (fast)
* Tested code for quadrant 3, power supply cable broke and halted testing
* Mounted front sensor
* Wrote code for quadrant 3 and 4(yet to be tested)
* Fixed power supply cable

#Week 4 
Checklist:
- [x] Tim and Cam: Implement error signals to allow to navigate corner tape
- [x] Ian: Design an update for the robot
- [x] Zala: ~~Test robot to run through the first and second progress~~(not possible due to unfinished robot), update github with progress, help with design
- [x] James: Assist with robot design and organize meetup
Progress:
* Tested code for gate
